# dual_panda_sim
Customizable panda simulation world on gazebo with three objects, *"rod"*, *"stone"* and a *"box"* along with two franka emika panda arms. 

# Abstract

A python script is designed to inquire about the selection of the object along with the dimensions required by the user, to initate a gazebo simulation of the respective object with two panda arms. After the official installation of the franka emika, ros noetic in a ubuntu environment verison 20.04. Store the folder *"run_sim_py"* in the *"franka_gazebo"* folder and contents of repository's *"models"* folder to the *"models"* folder present in the *"franka_gazebo"*.

# Installation of Franka kernel

The official franka kernel installation steps can be found here https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/installation_linux.html

# Process

After the sucessful installation of the franka kernel, navigate to the *run_sim_py* folder and run the *main.py* script and follow the instructions

Input has to be provided, if notthing to providing. please use the default values mentioned in the output.

Three windows will be started
1. Gazebo simulation
2. Rviz window for each franka emika arm. 

## Box

## Rod

The orientation of the rod can be adjusted by changing the *<pose>* tag present in the *franka_gazebo/models/rod/model_template.sdf*, present under *<link name='link'>*

## Stone

# rosgraphs and workflow

Here you can take a look at the rosgraph of all the topics and nodes that are being used while the simulation is running

# Current status
Motion planning of each hand 

# Moveit_config
Added functionality of using move_it with the arms, in order to test planners and controllers for future tasks.Moveit package needs to be installed
- Start setup_assistant
```
roslaunch moveit_setup_assistant setup_assistant.launch
```

- Follow the given the link to setup the poses and planners for the arms in setup assistant -- https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/doc/setup_assistant/setup_assistant_tutorial.html
- Check if the planners are working with launching demo.launch,which will launch rviz with Moveit IDE.
  ```
  roslaunch {moveit_package_name} demo.launch
  ```
